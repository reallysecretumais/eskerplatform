# ROADMAP — Esker Stays

Where we are and what's left. Pairs with `SESSION_HANDOFF.md`. (✅ done · 🟡 partial · ⬜ not started · ⚠️ blocked on a founder action)

## Done ✅
- **Foundation + security wall** — public data layer (`public_listings`, `public_availability`), RLS, adversarially verified.
- **Homepage** (Concept B) — concierge hero over a 3D drifting photo-wall, category showcase, Esker Exclusive row, trust strip.
- **Search** `/stays` (filters + AI mode) and **property pages** (gallery, "Ask about this place", grouped amenities, Built-for-Pakistan §8, location map §6, trust line, booking widget).
- **AI concierge** — retrieval-first (OpenAI, public data only), Roman-Urdu-in/English-out, streaming, "find similar". Leak-tested.
- **Accounts** — guest/owner/partner additive roles; email+password; login/signup/account; account-aware nav; verified isolation. Phone+OTP built (dormant).
- **Booking flow** — checkout, first-time CNIC/passport + **AI ID check (rejects expired)**, real bank accounts, screenshot → `awaiting_payment`/`source=Website` into the CRM; "My bookings".
- **Property descriptions** auto-generated into `public_description`.
- **WhatsApp "Request a price"** — BookingWidget links to `wa.me/923325977626` prefilled.

## Since launch — booking upgrades + pre-launch quality pass ✅ (2026-07-04)
- **Booking**: ₨2,000 minimum advance (capped at total, honest label) · **real-time AI ID check** (CNIC front+back, passport single page; Confirm blocked until valid) · payment-provider seam for a future gateway.
- **Accounts backbone** (portals Phase 1): every booker gets an account (magic link); `08_accounts_links.sql` adds owner/relationship/comms columns.
- **Quality pass** (commit `28555e8`): SlimListing payload cut (property −21%, AI search −46%) · lazy `<img>` cards with alt/srcset (original 4:3 card, cover-cropped — shows more of the portrait library than a wider 3:2) · hero srcset 640/1000/1400 (sharp on desktop) · hero elevation (staggered entrance, serif-gold word, shimmer CTA, cursor gold light, CSS-only sway on mobile, edge mask, scroll cue) · AI **WHY** reasons + refine chips · Help→WhatsApp · featured=6 honest heading · hold reassurance · slot-booking WhatsApp CTA · dead code removed.

## Phase 1 — COMPLETE ✅ (deployed to eskerrentals.com)
Foundation + security wall · homepage/search/property pages · **text + voice AI concierge** · accounts + password reset · booking flow + AI ID check · **advance payments (25/50%)** · availability + 18h auto‑release · **guest notifications (email + WhatsApp‑queued) + team alerts** · **reviews** (curated) · **SEO + AI discoverability** · **Meta Pixel/CAPI** · **caching + revalidate webhook** · brand logo/favicon · premium descriptions · legal pages. Full status + remaining founder actions in **`PHASE1_LAUNCH_CHECKLIST.md`**.

Small leftovers: real‑device mobile pass · optional PNG app icons · post‑stay review capture.

## Next builds ⬜ — the APPROVED portals + chat program (plan in shared memory `platform-portals-chat-program`)
Three owner tiers: **partner** (investor, Esker-comms, read-only share/recovery) · **managed** (external owner Esker handles comms for; sees "the business Esker brought you", margin hidden, soft upsell) · **host** (self-lists, owner-comms). Unified inventory: everything public lives in `properties` with `owner_relationship`/`comms_owner` flags.
1. **Phase 2 — Messaging** ← NEXT: guest↔Esker chat (pre-booking inquiry from the property page + post-confirmation chatbox), realtime, reusing the CRM Unified Inbox (`'website'` channel + account-scoped RLS, CRM migration `phase21.sql`).
2. **Phase 3 — Host portal**: self-listing (admin-approved) + owner↔guest chat with Esker oversight + WhatsApp notify. ⚠️ Needs the payout/commission decision first.
3. **Phase 4 — Partner + Managed portals**: read-only, relationship-appropriate views; deal math stays server-side.
4. **Real payment gateway** — drop Safepay/PayFast behind `lib/payments/provider.ts`; keep screenshot‑verify until then.
5. **Voice quality jump** — ElevenLabs or OpenAI Realtime when ready (OpenAI TTS is at its ceiling).

## Later phases ⬜
- **Phone+OTP** for guests — switch on by adding an SMS provider in Supabase (no code change).
- **NADRA Verisys** — real CNIC verification against the national DB (regulated API agreement); slots in after the AI ID extraction.
- **Real payment gateway** — behind the same booking flow (provider interface). Keep screenshot-verify until then.
- **Content Spaces (hourly)** + **Swimming Pools (slot/day-use)** booking models — the unit logic exists (`unitForCategory`/`formatPrice`); wire slot/hour selection when those listings are added.
- **Multi-city** beyond Islamabad/Rawalpindi (city is a first-class dimension; don't hardcode the two launch cities).
- **Services & experiences** (beyond stays), reviews maturity, host self-signup + escrow + ops-brain fraud detection (master plan Phase 2–3).
- Optional CRM polish: a "Website · awaiting verification" badge + one-click "confirm payment".

## North star
A premium, AI-first, Pakistan-native booking site where a guest says what they want and gets the right real place — anchored by Esker Exclusive, on the same brain as the CRM. Build the bounded, brilliant version first.
